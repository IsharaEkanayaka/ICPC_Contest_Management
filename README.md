2.  **Run the Contest Data System (CDS):**
    -   Navigate to the `icpc_tools/cds/` directory.
    -   **Important:** Before running, update `cdsConfig.xml` with the correct contest number and `accounts.yaml` with your desired credentials (you can use `accounts.yaml.template` as a guide).
    -   Run the CDS with the following command:
        ```bash
        docker run --name cds --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -v ./cdsConfig.xml:/opt/wlp/usr/servers/cds/config/cdsConfig.xml -v ./accounts.yaml:/opt/wlp/usr/servers/cds/config/accounts.yaml -v ./data:/data ghcr.io/icpctools/cds:2.7.1346
        ```

3.  **Set Up Judgehosts:**
    -   Follow the detailed guide in the `judgehosts/` directory to set up your judgehosts.
